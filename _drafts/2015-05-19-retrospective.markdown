I'm just two weeks away from graduation. In my downtime, before I ship off to work in the Big Apple, I thought I'd take some time to reflect on the past four years.

I first stepped into my dorm what seems like both a decade and a few months ago. Even recent events, such as my last final exam, now feel like events in another life. The ups and downs of all eight semesters are in the rear-view mirror, but the odometer keeps ticking. I suppose that having evolved so profoundly in just a few years tends to warp your sense of time. 

Here are a few things I learned from my stint as an undergrad:

1. You benefit from attending a university where no one holds your hand. McGill is one of those places. If you want to switch majors: do the research, contact your advisor, and apply before the deadline. If something seems off with the mark on your transcript: do the math, and email the professor. **Taking responsibility for my education taught me to think twice before finalizing any decision.*** 
2. Speak to your professors.
3. Get involved. If you're disappointed about the course offerings in your department, run for VP Academic within your undergrad society. Never rely on someone else to do something 
4. Find a balance between food and gym therapy. Disappointed? Have a hamburger. Angry? Go run a mile or two. 
5. Don't stagnate. Always keep pushing forward. In school, there's always another semester, another internship, another set of assignments. Juggling a million deadlines 
6. An organized calendar is fewer wrinkles. During crunch time last semester there was a four-day period within which over half of my mark in three of my four courses was to be determined. 


My imposter syndrome is currently through the roof. How could a highly reputed university be awarding me with a degree? Sure, I went to class, pulled a few all-nighters, and finished with a decent average.
