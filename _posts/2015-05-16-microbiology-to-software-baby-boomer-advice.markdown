Anyone will tell you that their first year of university was simply a string of uncertainties, with the occasional (or regular) existential crisis. My first year at McGill as no exception.

I was sold to the core that I was meant to study molecular biology, and change the field forever with my research contributions throughout my prolific career. About three weeks into my first biology course, however, I developed an undeniable sense that I was completely wrong. Being the neurotic person I am, with the compulsive need to have a five year plan, I began making a list of alternative majors. 

By the first week of October, only a month into my university career, I had the following list: chemical engineering, and architecture.

In fact, I'd already substituted the biology coursework from my upcoming semester with additional requirements for the McGill engineering program: an introductory computer science course and a linear algebra course.

I remember the slight hesitation at registering for my first programming course. My father completed a bachelors in Computer Science in the 1980s and went on to teach at a local CEGEP (this is approximately the Quebecois equivalent of a community college). I'd been surrounded by computers and high-speed internet from an early age. (In fact, as I'd later confirm, my father had actually engineered some of his assignments such that they were entertaining computer game his toddler daughter at the time (me) would enjoy -- thus saving him quite a few hours of marking.)

Although I was rather convinced I'd switch into the Faculty of Engineering for either chemical engineering or architecture, I wasn't confident at all in my ability to succeed in a programming course. Shortly following registration, I called my mom. In hindsight, it seems silly, but I told her not to breathe a word of the programming course to my father. I was afraid I'd disappoint him if I didn't enjoy it or struggled with the material. 

About two weeks into my introductory programming course, I was in love. I loved programming. It was so logical, so beautifully simple. I would pour hours into the programming assignments without noticing.

The deadline approached for program transfer applications to the Faculty of Engineering. My portfolio was ready to send to the printer. My scores in my organic chemistry course had the pre-med students steaming. Yet, I found myself applying to transfer to chemical and software engineering. 

A few months passed. I took a summer course in anticipation of my change of program. When the decisions came in and the Faculty of Engineering was over capacity, I was left with my second choice: software engineering. I was disappointed at first, but as I began registering for courses in the fall, my disappointment was quickly replaced with enthusiasm.

I was with my parents when I found out I'd be studying software engineering. My father took a few moments to sit down with me. He wanted to warn me about the student culture in computer science and, later, the work culture. He told me that I'd be competing for top marks in introductory-level courses where most of the students have been programming since their early teens. I'd have to deal with frustrations that some would have encountered in high school. I'd be debugging programs for hours longer than most simply because of my lack of experience. I'd be attempting to sprint up a cliff, whereas the majority of my classmates would already be at the top, looking down below at the few struggling.

My father warned me about the sexism. Although women in the program were more common in the years he attended university, they were few and far between now. He told me that some of the guys, taking too much pride in their "nerdiness" and their true "geek" attitude, would assume that just because I am a woman, I wouldn't do as well as them.

"It's not all bleak," he added, "I'll help you." He said he'd answer my questions at any hour of the day. He knew I'd be afraid to ask for help until I found a stable group of friends within my new major. He said to look out for the good ones -- the ones that seemed more outgoing and open-minded. "And when you've moved on to higher-level courses, you'll be the one they'll be flooding to for help," he insisted. The "nerds" I'd be competing with in my early programming courses would have a more difficult time with the more abstract concepts, particularly when it came to software architecture. "They can program all they want," he said, "but when it comes to work ethic for courses that involve more than just lines of code on a screen, they won't have what you have."

Over the years, I've found that what my father told me then was mostly true. And thankfully, I found a great bunch of friends; friends that challenged me, helped me, and molded me into the woman I am today, just weeks away from graduation. Sure, when it came to programming, it was a rough hike. When it came to algorithms, data structures and just about everything else, I put in the work and was rewarded with high marks accordingly. When it came to writing a technical report, I became my groupmates' go-to person.

You learn to deal with the assholes. You learn to deal with the sexist comments. You latch on to those who support you (my father, my friends). Looking back, it wasn't easy but would have never had it any other way.
